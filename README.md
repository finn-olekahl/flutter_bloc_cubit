# Flutter BloC Cubit Repository Pattern:


# The Cubit is a subset of the famous implementation of BLoC Pattern: 
bloclibrary.dev, 
it abandons the concept of Events and simplifies the way of emitting states.
# What’s a Cubit?
It’s a class that stores an observable state, the observation is powered by Streams but in such a friendly way that it is not necessary to know reactive programming
Use super() to override the initial state.
